------

This codebase contains MATLAB code for several methods of characterizing soot aggregates in TEM images. This includes methods for evaluating the aggregate projected area, perimeter, and primary particle diameter. Methods include Otsu thresholding, the pair correlation method (PCM), Hough circle transform (following [Kook et al. (2015)](kook)), the Euclidean distance mapping, scale-based analysis (EDM-SBS) method of [Bescond et al. (2014)][bescond], and tools to aid in manual analysis. This code is designed to replace a [previous, deprecated code](https://github.com/unatriva/UBC-PCM). 

**Testing** of this codebase makes use of the `main_*` functions in the upper directory, which are described in [1. MAIN SCRIPTS (main_\*)](#1-main-scripts-main_) below. Specifically, `main_kmeans` and `main_auto` test the fully automated methods, while `main_0` allows for testing of the more manual methods (which require substantial user input). 

The program is primarily composed of two analysis packages, which will be discussed later in the README: 

1. **+agg** - which performs aggregate-level segmentation to output a binary image, and 

2. **+pp** - which determines primarily particle information, often from the binary image generated by the methods in the **agg** package noted above. 

This code also includes a set of utility functions in the **+tools** package and Python code necessary to implement a convolutional neural network used for segmentation in the [carboseg](https://github.com/tsipkens/atems/tree/master/carboseg) folder.

# A. Dependencies

This software was tested using MATLAB 2022a (though most functions have been validated against older versions). The current code depends on the following MATLAB toolboxes: 

1. the curve fitting toolbox, 
2. the financial toolbox, 
3. the image toolbox, 
4. the optimization toolbox, and 
5. the video and image blockset (in the computer vision toolbox, which is used for OCR). 

If not already installed, these packages can be added to MATLAB via the instructions available on [MATLAB's website](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/get-add-ons.html). 

This program also has an *optional* submodule that adds support for perceptually uniform colormaps compiled from various sources and available at https://github.com/tsipkens/cmap. It can be added via git using

```Shell
git submodule add -b master https://github.com/tsipkens/cmap
git submodule init
```

The submodule is not necessary for any of the scripts or methods included with this code. 

Additional dependencies are required for use of the **[carboseg](https://github.com/tsipkens/atems/tree/master/carboseg)** or convolutional neural network component of this program, including a copy of Python. See the appropriate [section below](#+-carboseg-and-cnn-segmentation) for more information. 

This code has been tested on Windows 10+. Linux users may have some issues with loading images when supplying a string to `tools.load_imgs(...)` (for example, because of differences in file separator). macOS users may encounter similar issues, including in writing aggregate structures to JSON files and in certain plotting functions. 

# B. Getting started

The overall structure of scripts associated with this code can be broken down into three steps. 

![original](docs/process.png)

### STEP 1: Load images

The first step in the image analysis process is to import images. Images can be handled in one of two ways. 

The first is as a MATLAB structure, with one entry in the structure for each image loaded. To generate this structure, one can use the `tools.load_imgs(...)` function, either giving a folder name as an input or no argument (to use a file explorer). To use the test images:

```Matlab
Imgs = tools.load_imgs('images');  % load the images
```

The output structure contains the image file name and directory; the  image itself, with and without the footer removed (or `cropped`); and  the pixel size, read from the image footer. Alternatively, one can use a file explorer to select the folders by  excluding any arguments: 

```Matlab
Imgs = tools.load_imgs;  % load the images
```

Second, the image can also be handled using a cell array of cropped images and pixel sizes. These are secondary outputs to the `tools.load_imgs(...)` function: 

```Matlab
[~, imgs, pixsizes] = tools.load_imgs('images'); % load the images
```

The images and pixel sizes can equivalently be extracted from the `Imgs` structure using:

```Matlab
imgs = {Imgs.cropped}; % copy variables locally
pixsizes = [Imgs.pixsize]; % pixel size for each image
fname = {Imgs.fname};
```

We note that detecting the footer and pixel size (or scale) uses the `detect_footer_scale(...)` subfunction of the `tools.load_imgs(...)` method. This function attempts to interpret the image footer and/or scale using image analysis tools. The method is known to work with TEM images taken at the University of British Columbia, where it applies optical character recognition to determine the pixel size from the footer text (stored in the `Imgs.pixsize` field and/or output directly as `pixsizes`) and crops the footer away. Black text and a scale bar overlaid on the image may also be readable, but present more challenges such that determining the pixel size is not always successful. In cases where this latter approach is used, the code will attempt to fill the overlaid scale elements with background noise, to improve subsequent analyses. Should all of this fail, the user can also call the `tools.ui_scale_bar(imgs)` function to use a UI to estimate the pixel size for the cell of raw images specified by `imgs`. Type

```Matlab
help tools.ui_scale_bar;
```

on the MATLAB command line for more information on that function. 

> NOTE: At the moment, this approach will load all of the images into memory. For computers with less memory, this could restrict the number of images that can be analyzed at one time. Batches of 250 images have been run successfully on a computer with 16 GB of RAM (MATLAB limits memory usage to below this value). A simple work around is to load the images in groups, rather than all at once, and then add an outer loop to proceed through the different groups. The `tools.load_imgs(fd, n)` function is equipped to handle this, passing the second, optional argument `n` as the integer range of images to load into memory. For example, `n = 1:3` will load the first three images from the set specified by `fd`. 

### STEP 2: Aggregate-level segmentation

The next step is to evaluate binary masks that separate the image into pixels that are part of the background and pixels that are part of aggregates. This is done using the functions in the **+agg** package. For example, a *k*-means classifier can be used by calling:

```Matlab
imgs_binary = agg.seg_kmeans(imgs, pixsizes);
    % segment aggregates
```

The result, `imgs_binary`, is either a single binary image (if one image is given as an input) or a cell array of image binaries (if multiple images are given as an input), with `1` if a pixel is considered part of the aggregate and `0` if it is not. Other approaches are also available and are discussed in [Section 2](#2-aggregate-segmentation-package-agg) below. 

Having segmented the image, aggregate characteristics can be determined by passing this binary image to the `tools.analyze_binary(...)` function, e.g.:

```Matlab
Aggs = agg.analyze_binary(...
    imgs_binary, pixsizes, imgs, fname);
        % determine aggregate properties
```

The output data itself, `Aggs`, is a MATLAB structure with one entry per aggregate, containing properties like the location of the aggregate, perimeter, and projected-area. This data can then be exported to a JSON file using :

```Matlab
tools.write_json(Aggs, fname);
```

or an Excel spreadsheet using: 

```Matlab
tools.write_excel(Aggs, fname);
```

to be analyzed in other software and languages, where `fname` is the filename of the file to write to. The `Aggs` structure can also be visualized as an overlay on top of the TEM image using

```Matlab
figure(1);
tools.imshow_agg(Aggs);
```

The resultant image highlights pixels that are part of the aggregate, and plots a circle that corresponds to the radius of gyration. This output is similar to that shown the image in the header of this README. 

### STEP 3: Determining the primary particle size

Primary particle size information can finally be determined using functions in the **+pp** package. The original pair correlation method (PCM), for example, can be applied by using the `Aggs` output from the `agg.analyze_binary(...)` function as

```Matlab
Aggs = pp.pcm(Aggs); % apply pair correlation method
```

The output is an updated `Aggs` structure that also contains an estimate of the primary particle size for each aggregate. Having done this, the primary particle size can be visualized along with the radius of gyration noted above by passing the updated `Aggs` structure to the `tools.plot_aggregates(...)` function:

```Matlab
figure(2);
tools.imshow_agg(Aggs);
```

The inner circle in this plot now indicates the primary particle size from PCM, the larger circle the radius of gyration from *k*-means, and the number indicating the index used by the program to identify each aggregate. Images produced using this type of procedure will feature heavily in the remainder of this README. 

### Running this example

Code associated with this example is given in the script **main_b.m**. The output should correspond to the figure shown below. 

![](docs/output_b.png)

# C. Components

This section provides details of the overall structure of this codebase and the methods available for the characterization of soot aggregates in TEM images. 

## 1. MAIN SCRIPTS (main_\*): Testing the codebase

The main scripts demonstrate further use of the code for specific scenarios and are provided to **test the codebase**. Three such scripts are included: 

**main_b** is the script associated with the demonstration in [B. Getting started](#b-getting-started) above. 

**main_kmeans** is designed to specifically investigate the *k*-means approach to aggregate-level segmentation. By default, this is done on the sample images provided in the [images](https://github.com/tsipkens/atems/tree/master/images) folder included with this distribution. This script will also read in some binaries (provided in the [images/slider](https://github.com/tsipkens/atems/tree/master/images/slider) folder) produced by the slider method beforehand for comparison. Finally, the primary particle size is computed for the *k*-means binaries and is plotted for the user. This script supports a European Aerosol Conference submission ([Sipkens et al., 2020][eac20]).

**main_auto** runs through most of the fully automated techniques provided with this program (e.g., *k*-means, Otsu, PCM, etc.), applying them to the images provided in the [images](https://github.com/tsipkens/atems/tree/master/images) folder. The binary images produced by each method are overlaid on the original images for inspection by the user. Outputs are similar to those presented in [Section 2](#2-aggregate-segmentation-package-agg) below. 

**main_0** script presents use of the `agg.seg(...)` general segmentation function, described [below](#a-general-segmentation-function-seg), as well as how to read in one's own images. At the end of the script, data is written to an Excel file for examination external to MATLAB. Note that this requires that the user's images be formatted appropriately, either with a horizontal footer below the TEM image that has a white background or a cropped TEM image, in which case the user will have to provide pixel size information. Sample images on which the method have been tested are again found in the  [images](https://github.com/tsipkens/atems/tree/master/images) folder. 

## 2. AGGREGATE SEGMENTATION PACKAGE (+agg)

This package contains an expandable library of functions aimed at performing semantic segmentation of the TEM images into aggregate and background regions. Functions are accessed by appending `agg.` to the function name, e.g., `agg.seg_kmeans(...)` to call the *k*-means segmentation procedure. 

These images are included with this distribution in the `images/` folder. These images represent soot collected from a lab-scale flare ([Trivanovic et al., 2020][triv20]) and a diesel engine ([Kheirkhah et al., 2020][kheirkhah20]). 

### 2.1 agg.seg\* functions

The main functions implementing aggregate-level semantic segmentation have filenames following the template `agg.seg_*`. In each case, the output primarily consists of binary images of the same size as the original image but where pixels take on logical values: `1` for pixels identified as part of the aggregate `0` for pixels identified as part of the background. 

The functions often take similar inputs and provide a binary mask output. As a general template, 

```Matlab
img_binary = agg.seg_slider_orig(imgs, ...)
```

 where the `imgs` input is one of:

1. a single image (after any footer or additional information have been removed); 
3. an `Imgs` structure, containing the image information as fields; or
3. a cell array of images (again with the footer removed).

and the `img_binary` output is a cell of binary masks. Several methods also take `pixsize`, which denotes the size of each pixel in the image. If an `Imgs` structure if provided, this information is expected to be contained in this structure and any `pixsize` input is ignored. Other arguments depend on the function (e.g., optional parameters for the rolling ball transform). For input arguments relevant to any given method, please refer to function headers and/or definitions. 

Several of the available methods are summarized briefly below. 

### + **seg_kmeans** / *k*-means segmentation

This function applies a *k*-means segmentation approach following [Sipkens and Rogak (2021)][jaskmeans] and using three feature layers, which include: (*i*) a *denoised* version of the image; (*ii*) a measure of *texture* in the image; and (*iii*) an Otsu-like classified image, with the *threshold adjusted* upwards. This method works well for a large range of images, e.g., 

![i_kmeans](docs/kmeans.png)

Though, the technique still occasionally fails, particularly if the function does not adequately remove the background. The method also has some notable limitations when images are (i) *zoomed in* on a single aggregate while (ii) also slightly overexposed. The k-means method is associated with configuration files (cf., [+agg/conifg/](https://github.com/tsipkens/atems/tree/master/%2Bagg/config)), which include different versions and allow for tweaking of the options associated with the method. See the `seg_kmeans(...)` function header or type `help agg.seg_kmeans` for more information, including configuration versions and function arguments. 

### + **carboseg** / Neural network-based segmentation 

This `seg_carboseg(...)` function employs Python to implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) for segmentation as described by [Sipkens et al.][ptech.cnn] Details and code for the training of the network are available in a parallel repository at https://github.com/maxfrei750/CarbonBlackSegmentation, with primary contributions by Max Frei ([@maxfrei750](https://github.com/maxfrei750)). The implementation here makes use of the ONNX file output (to be downloaded [here](https://uni-duisburg-essen.sciebo.de/s/J7bS47nZadg4bBH/download)) from that procedure and employs the Python ONNX runtime for execution. Use of this function requires the necessary Python environment as a pre-requisite. 

> We also note that, as of this writing, MATLAB does not support the necessary layers to import the ONNX as a native MATLAB object. 

Details on the setup and use of this component are given in the [README](carboseg/README.md) in the **carboseg** subfolder. Two options exist for interacting with the Python code: (1) initializing an instance of Python directly in MATLAB or (2) a multi-step procedure of exporting and reimporting images. 


### + **seg_otsu\*** / Otsu thresholding

These automated methods apply Otsu thresholding followed by a rolling ball transformation. Two versions of this function are included. 

**A.** The `agg.seg_otsu_orig(...)` function remains more true to the original code of [Dastanpour et al. (2016)][dastanpour2016]. For the sample images, this often results in fragmented segmentations, e.g., 

![rb_orig](docs/otsu_rb_orig.png)

As the technique may be insufficient on its own, this implementation can be complimented with `agg.seg_slider(...)`, described [below](#-seg_slider_orig--gui-based-slider-method), to fill in the gaps between the aggregates and add missing aggregates. 

**B.** Stemming from the deficiencies of the above function, the `agg.seg_otsu(...)` function updates the above implementation by (*i*) not immediately removing boundary aggregates, (*ii*) adding a background subtraction step using the `agg.bg_subtract(...)` function, and (*iii*) adding a bilateral denoising step. This results in the following segmentations.

![otsu_rb](docs/otsu_rb.png)

This latter function generally performs better, though the results are still significantly fragmented. The technique generally underperforms relative to the previously mentioned *k*-means method but acts as a good way to initialize more manual techniques. 

### + **seg_slider_orig\*** / GUI-based slider methods

The `agg.seg_slider_orig(...)` method is a largely manual technique originally developed by [Ramin Dastanpour](https://github.com/rdastanpour) ([Dastanpour et al., 2016)][dastanpour2016]). The function enacts a GUI-based method with a slider for adaptive, semi-automatic thresholding of the image (*adaptive* in that small sections of the image can be cropped and assigned individually-selected thresholds). It is worth noting that the mostly manual nature of this approach will resulting in variability and subjectiveness between users but that the human input often greatly improves the quality of the segmentations. See the `seg_slider_orig(...)` function header or type `help agg.seg_slider_orig`, including usage. 

> We note that this code saw important bug updates since the original code by [Dastanpour et al. (2016)][dastanpour2016]. This includes fixing how the original code would repeatedly apply a Gaussian filter every time the user interacted with the slider in the GUI (which may cause some backward compatibility issues), a reduction in the use of global variables, memory savings, and other performance improvements. 

The core of the `seg_slider(...)` method is the same as the GUI-based slider method described above but sees an overhaul of the user interface. This implementation makes use of MATLAB's app builder, requiring newer MATLAB versions to use. 

<img src="docs/slider2_screenshot.png" alt="slider2_screenshot" width="400"/>

### + **seg** / A general segmentation function

The `agg.seg(...)` function is a general, multipurpose wrapper function that attempts several methods listed here in sequence, prompting the user after each attempt. Specifically, the method attempts (*i*) the *k*-means classifier, (*ii*) followed by the Otsu classifier, and finally (*iii*) reverts to using the slider method. This is repeated until the user has classified all of the images that were passed to the function. 

### 2.2 analyze_binary / Getting particle properties

All of the above methods produce a common output: a binary image. The `agg.analyze_binary(...)` function is now used to convert these binaries to aggregate characteristics, such as area in pixels, radius of gyration, area-equivalent diameter, aspect ratio, among other quantities. The function itself takes a binary image, the original image, and the pixel size as inputs, as follows. 

```Matlab
Aggs = agg.analyze_binary(imgs_binary, pixsize, imgs, fname);
```

The output is a MATLAB structured array, `Aggs`, containing information about the aggregate. The array has one entry for each aggregate found in the image, which is itself defined as any independent groupings of pixels. The `fname` argument is optional and adds this tag to the information in the output `Aggs` structure. 

### 2.3 rolling_ball / Apply a rolling ball transformation

Multiple of these methods make use of the **rolling ball transformation**, applied using the `agg.rolling_ball(...)` function included with this package. This transform fills in gaps inside aggregates, acting as a kind of noise filter. This is accomplished by way iterative morphological opening and closing. 

## 3. PRIMARY PARTICLE ANALYSIS PACKAGE (+pp)

The +pp package contains multiple methods for determining the primary particle size of the aggregates of interest. Often this requires a binary mask of the image that can be generated using the +agg package methods. After applying most of the methods, the primary particle size will be stored in (*i*) the `Aggs.dp` field and (*ii*) another `Aggs` field with additional information specifying the method used (e.g., `Aggs.dp_pcm1`  contains a PCM-derived primary particle diameter). For the former, whichever method was last used will overwrite the `Aggs.dp` field, which then acts as a default value that is used by other functions (by the `tools.imshow_agg(...)` function). 

### + **pcm** / Pair correlation method

The `pp.pcm` function contains code for the University of British Columbia's pair correlation method (PCM) method, originally developed by [Ramin Dastanpour](https://github.com/rdastanpour) ([Dastanpour et al. (2016)][dastanpour2016]). This package contains a significant improvements to code readability, memory use, and length relative to the previous code. The underlying method is largely unchanged, correlating the relationship between pixels to the primary particle size for a given aggregate. A single average primary particle diameter is given for each aggregate. [Dastanpour et al.][dastanpour2016] provided two different types of pair correlation function (PCF), corresponding to `Aggs.dp_pcm1`, previously denoted as *simple* and `Aggs.dp_pcm2`, previously denoted as *general*. Testing has generally suggested that the simple method perform better, and this value is assigned to `Aggs.dp` in the output from the PCM method. 

### + **edm_sbs** / EDM-SBS

The Euclidean distance mapping, scale-based analysis (EDM-SBS) of [Bescond et al. (2014)][bescond] is implement in the `pp.edm_sbs(...)` function. This is an adaptation of the original code for use with MATLAB and using the binaries above in the place of output from imageJ. As such, some minor differences in output should be expected (which are challenging to compare, as the ImageJ output does not have a direct analog here). The method remains true to how it is described in [Bescond et al.][bescond] and ports some components from the original Scilab code (version 3, available [here](http://www.coria.fr/spip.php?article910)). 

Among the changes to the original EDM-SBS code, this implementation also applies the EDM-SBS method to individual aggregates. While this allows for a better comparison to the other methods here, the method was originally intended to evaluate the primary particle size distribution across a range of aggregates, with uncertaintainty ramifications. However, the linear nature of the curves generated by the method means that the overall EDM-SBS curve is simply approximated by the superposition of all of the aggregates. This is also output by the present code.  

### + **kook\*** / Hough transform

Two `pp.hough_kook**(...)` functions are included with this program, which fit circles to features in the image using the Hough transform and the pre-processing steps described by [Kook et al. (2015)][kook]. 

The first function, `pp.hough_kook*(...)`, contains a copy of the code provided by [Kook et al. (2015)][kook], with minor modifications to match the input/output of some of the other packages — namely to take a single image, `img`, and a pixel size, `pixsize` — and to output a `Pp` structure, which contains information for each circle. Note that the original function acts on images without trying to assign primary particles to an aggregate, something resolved in the second function below. This causes some compatibility issues in terms of comparing the output from this function to the other methods contained in this program. 

The `pp.hough_kook2(...)` function contains a modified version of the method proposed by [Kook et al. (2015)][kook] that excludes circles in the background and assigns primary particles to aggregates. This is done rather simply:  by checking if the center of the circles from the preceding procedure lie within the binary for a given aggregate. A sample output is as follows. 

![kook2](docs/kook2.png)

Here, red circles are identified as part of an aggregate, while black circles are excluded in the output. Note that it is apparent from some of the images that gradients in the background influenced the results. Though, it can also be noted that the circles within the aggregates remain reasonable (to the extent that the overall method is reasonable). 

### + Manual sizing

The `pp.manual(...)` function can be used to manual draw circles around the soot primary particles. The code was developed at the University of British Columbia and represents a heavily modified version of the code associated with [Dastanpour and Rogak (2014)][dastanpour2014]. The current method uses two lines overlaid on each primary particle to select the length and width of the particle. This is converted to various quantities, such as the center of each primary particle and the overall mean primary particle diameter. 


## 4. ADDITIONAL TOOLS PACKAGE (+tools)

This package contains a series of functions that help in visualizing or analyzing the aggregates that transcend multiple methods or functions. We discuss a few examples here and refer the reader to individual functions for more information. 

### + **tools.imshow\*** / Functions to show images
**
These functions aid in visualizing the resultant images. For example, 

```Matlab
tools.imshow_binary(img, img_binary);
```

will plot the image, given in `img`, and overlay labels for the aggregates in a corresponding binary image, given in `img_binary`.  Appending an `opts` structure to the function allows for the control of the appearance of the overlay, including the label alpha and colour. For example, 

```Matlab
opts.cmap = [0.92,0.16,0.49];
tools.imshow_binary(img, img_binary, opts);
```

will plot the overlays in a red, while 

```Matlab
opts.cmap = [0.99,0.86,0.37];
tools.imshow_binary(img, img_binary, opts);
```

will plot the overlays in a yellow. 

The related `tools.imshow_agg(...)` function will plot the binaries, as above, and add aggregate-level information to the plot, including: (*i*) the aggregate number; (*ii*) the radius of gyration about the center of the aggregate; and (*iii*) the average primary particle diameter, if this information is available (the function will use the `Aggs.dp` field, which will contain primary particle information from the most recently applied method). 

### + **tools.write\*** / Functions to write data to files

This set of functions writes data to files, with the precise format depending on the function. 

The `tools.write_excel(...)` and `tools.write_json(...)` functions write aggregate-level information to Excel and JSON formats respectively. The precise output will depend on what information is contained in the `Aggs` structure given to the method. For example, `Aggs` structures with primary particle information will have that information output to the Excel or JSON files. 

The `tools.write_images(...)` function, in contrast, take a cell of images (or a single image) and writes them to a series of files, specified by the `fnames` argument, in the folder specified by the `folder` argument. For example, this can be used to write the binary images presented at the beginning of this README to a temporary folder using

```Matlab
tools.imwrite(imgs_binary, fname, 'temp');
```

This function is also useful when paired with the `tools.imshow_agg(...)` function to write images with binary overlays and radius of gyration information (such as those presented throughout this README). For a series of images that have been processed to produce an `Aggs` structure, this can be accomplished using: 

```Matlab
imgs_agg{length(imgs)} = []; % initialize cell

% Loop through images and get overlay for each image. 
% The second argument of tools.imshow_agg gets the 
% colordata from the frame in the overlay image. 
for ii=1:length(imgs)
    [~, imgs_agg{ii}] = tools.imshow_agg(Aggs, ii, 1, opts);
end

% Write the overlay images to a temporary folder
tools.write_images(imgs_agg, fname, 'temp');
```

As the image size will depend on the physical size of the figure on the screen, it may be useful to first run

```Matlab
f1 = figure(1); f1.WindowState = 'maximized';
```

to maximize the figure window, to generate higher quality output. 

### + **tools.viz\*** / Functions to visualize post-processed results

This set of functions is intended to generate formatted plots of post-processed results. For example, `tools.viz_darho` generates a scatter plot of the area-equivalent diameter versus effective density estimated for each aggregate.

This work was supported by Dr. Steven Rogak ([rogak@mech.ubc.ca](mailto:rogak@mech.ubc.ca)). Other direct contributors include [Hamed Nikookar](https://github.com/Hamed-NKR) and [Darwin Zhu](https://github.com/darwinz7). 

Pieces of this code were adapted from various sources and features snippets written by several individuals at UBC, including [Ramin Dastanpour](https://github.com/rdastanpour), [Una Trivanovic](https://github.com/unatriva), Alberto Baldelli, Yiling Kang, Yeshun (Samuel) Ma, and Steven Rogak, among others.

This program contains very significantly modified versions of the code distributed with [Dastanpour et al. (2016)][dastanpour2016]. The most recent version of the Dastanpour et al. code prior to this overhaul is available at https://github.com/unatriva/UBC-PCM (which itself presents a minor update from the original). That code forms the basis for some of the methods underlying the manual processing and the PCM method used in this code, as noted in the README above. However, significant optimizations have improved code legibility, performance, and maintainability (e.g., the code no longer uses global variables). 

Also included with this program is the MATLAB code of [Kook et al. (2015)][kook], modified to accommodate the expected inputs and outputs common to the other functions.

This code also contain an adaptation of **EDM-SBS** method of [Bescond et al. (2014)][bescond]. We thank the authors, in particular Jérôme Yon, for their help in understanding their original [Scilab code and ImageJ plugin](https://www.coria.fr/en/edm-sbs-automated-analysis-of-tem-images/). Modifications to allow the method to work directly on binary images (rather than a custom output from ImageJ) and to integrate the method into the MATLAB environment may present some minor compatibility issues, but allows use of the aggregate segmentation methods given in the **agg** package. 

The **carboseg** method follows from collaborative work with [Max Frei](https://github.com/maxfrei750) and is associated with [Sipkens et al. (2021)][ptech.cnn]. 

Finally, the progress bar in the function `tools.textbar`, which is used to indicate progress on some of the primary particle sizing techniques, is a modified version of that written by [Samuel Grauer](https://github.com/sgrauer).
